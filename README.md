# INFORMATION

HumHub PALAREAS theme is the theme I use for my own social network project called Palareas. 
Cause I want to contribute something to the nice HumHub community, I give away the theme for free.
Everyone can make use of it and update it to fit Your needs.

The theme is working for HumHub versions 0.20+

I will integrate some more features and also extra module styles in the next time.

Have fun with using it!

kind regards, Andreas
