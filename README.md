# INFORMATION

HumHub PALAREAS theme is the theme I use for my own social network project called Palareas. 
Cause I want to contribute something to the nice HumHub community, I give away the theme for free.
Everyone can make use of it and update it to fit Your needs.

The theme is working for HumHub versions 0.20 to 1.0.0 (I will no longer update the theme)

I will integrate some more features and also extra module styles in the next time.

Have fun with using it!

kind regards, Andreas
